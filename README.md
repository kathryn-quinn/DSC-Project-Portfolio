Points

Linear Model (0.5):

Why: Linear regression is ideal for analyzing relationships between continuous variables. It helps in understanding how one variable impacts another.

What to Compare: The model compares the relationship between wage costs and operating results. The scatter plot with a regression line visualizes this relationship, showing how changes in wage costs affect the financial performance of clubs.
________________________

Random Forest (1):
Why: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that provides high accuracy and robustness by combining multiple decision trees. It is particularly useful for understanding feature importance and handling complex interactions between features.

What to Compare: The model compares the importance of different features in predicting revenue and fan engagement. The feature importance plot helps identify which factors are most influential. The confusion matrix provides a comparison of the model's predictions against actual outcomes.
________________________

Logistic Regression (0.5):

Why: Logistic regression is a robust model for binary classification tasks. It is particularly useful for predicting whether a year will be a high revenue year based on various financial metrics.

What to Compare: The model compares the likelihood of a year being a high revenue year based on features such as 2022 Revenue, 2023 Wage costs, 2023 Op result, and 2023 Net pft/(loss) on sale of ply reg.. The evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) and visualizations (confusion matrix, ROC curve) help compare the model's predictions against actual outcomes.
________________________

Combining Datasets (0.5):

Why: Combining datasets from multiple sources provides a comprehensive view of the data, ensuring all relevant information is integrated for analysis.

What to Compare: The merged dataset allows for comparisons across different metrics and years, providing a holistic view of the league's performance.
________________________

Why: Creating my own database was necessary to integrate all relevant financial data that wasn't provided in a single document. This step ensures that all data is organized and accessible for analysis.

What to Compare: The database allows for comprehensive comparisons across various financial metrics, ensuring all relevant data is included in the analysis.
________________________

Cross Validation (0.5):

Why: Cross-validation is essential for assessing the robustness and generalizability of the models. It helps in understanding how the models perform on different subsets of the data.

What to Compare: The cross-validation scores provide a comparison of the model's performance across different folds, ensuring the model's reliability.
